==
MagicMirror Module for fitbit. You must create your application and store its details in `app_access.ini`. You must then authorise it at the appropriate url and get your first tokens. Store those in `tokens.ini`.

**WIP**: Currently only provides step count. Plan to expand to pretty much anything.
